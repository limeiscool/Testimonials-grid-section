## My process

Mobile-First Approach Heavy use of CSS Grid.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- minimal Flexbox
- Heavy use of CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The use of Grid-template-areas really helped this challenge become alot easier, once i understood it putting it to use was fairly easy.

```.grid-container {
    grid-template-areas: 
    'one one two three'
    'four five five three';
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  }
  ```

### Continued development

careful planning and sometimes best to scrap an idea if its creating more problems then solutions, trying a new aproach you may realize you completly overthought the challenge the first time and maybe even a few more times after that. However with a mind set that it can be done, you learn alot! Turns out my knowledge of Grid wasnt as good as i thought and spent alot of time having to review grid, i was unable to understand how to span across 2 columns or rows properly without thing getting really messed up. However with the video linked below helped me gained a better understanding. 

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - Helpful video for breaking down CSS grid using this Challenge as an example!
